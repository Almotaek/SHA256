# SHA256
The teamâ€™s goal is to implement the cryptography hash algorithm, SHA-256, on an FPGA board using a C programming language. Since FPGA boards have the ability to implement reconfigurable hardware logic, they have an advantage over custom hardware when designing complex algorithms such as the SHA 256. We use the software program VITIS HLS to perform high-level synthesis to convert the C code into RTL (register transfer level) which can then be implemented on the FPGA board.    The hash function should have the following properties, which would be checked either manually or through automated tests:  It is easy (but not necessarily quick) to compute the hash value for any given message.  It is infeasible to generate a message that has a given hash.  It is infeasible to modify a message without changing the hash.  It is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash.
